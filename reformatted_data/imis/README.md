The CSV here is a combination of the [sampling event combined data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_SamplingEventData.csv), and the [omics combined data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_OmicsData.csv), for all ARMS-MBON samples that have sequences in ENA. Additionally copied here, for those sampling events,   is the [spreadsheet of links to the image data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_ImageData.csv). 

These CSVs are then placed in the Marine Data Archive to be accessed via the 
IMIS metadata record: https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=8135
