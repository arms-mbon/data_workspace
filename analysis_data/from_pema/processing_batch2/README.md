In here are the input and output files from the second processing batch of PEMA runs on the ARMS-MBON sequences, which was the first one that used the LifeWatch IJI workflow. This covers the bioinformatics processing of the sequencing data from ARMS-MBON's sampling campaign 2020-2021 (i.e., all ARMS units deployed and retrieved between 2020 and 2021), where the processing was performed in chunks between Sept 2020 and August 2023.

The folders and files that are the outputs of processing_batch2 can be found in [analysis_release_002](https://github.com/arms-mbon/analysis_release_002/tree/main): all the files of processing_batch2 contributed to data_release_002.
