In spring of 2017 three elongated reefs were established just west of the Island Livø in the central part of Limfjorden. We are monitoring the effects on water movements, temperature and oxygen conditions as well as water clarity and nutrient levels. Also we have been monitoring the settlement of benthic organisms and will in early june 2019 conduct a thorough benthic biodiversity assessment of the reef. Our intention is to compare the ARMS based biodiversity with the more traditional monitoring.",13.4 - Coastal Brackish/Saline Lagoons/Marine Lakes,3,0,376,28,2019-11-11,2020-04-08
