In here are all the metadata and data links that are downloaded on a regular basis from the ARMS-MBON account on PlutoF.

The organisation of folders is by Observatory. In each Observatory folder are spreadsheets that contain the metadata provided in PluotF
* An overview of what has been done to-date: Observator(ies), ARMS units, sampling events, and the number of material samples, associated data (= digital samples, being images or spreadsheets), sequences, and observations that are in PlutoF
* Separate spreadsheets with the metadata on: material samples, sequences, observations, and associated data. Note that the primary purpose of PlutoF is to store the event metadata and images, and hence only the "AssociatedData" and "Overview" spreadsheets will be complete. The metadata in the "MaterialSamples", "Sequences", and "Observations" spreadsheets are incomplete and not to be used by the general visitor. These information are instead in the folders [FromGS](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/FromGS) and [Combined](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/Combined). 

The metadata downloaded from PlutoF undergo a QC, which modifies the various names (observatory, ARMS units) and IDs (event IDs, material sample IDs, sequence IDs, associated data IDs) so that they follow the rules encoded in the ARMS-MBON Handbook

These are part of the source data of the ARMS-MBON project, and from here are reorganised into other formats, standard, levels of interoperabilty, and published.
