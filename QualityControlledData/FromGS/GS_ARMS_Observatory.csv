Svalbard (Norway),NOR,Svalbard,S1,78.21302778,15.23361111,14,S,LTER site,LHI (Low human influence),9.3 - Subtidal Loose Rock/Pebble/Gravel  ,"The two arms sites are located in Isfjorden (Spitsbergen), on the southern shore, close to old inactive russian coal mining village Grumantbyen (S2) and river outlet Bjorndalen (S1). Both locations are distant from Longyearbyen harbour and located just beneath large bird cliffs. Characterized by steep slope of rocks and boulders overlying mud. Lager boulders occur at S1 while at S2 there are rocky shelves withs smaller rocks coming down steeply down to e.g. 15 m depth. Kelp forest are present up to 10 m depth. ARMS were located on 14 m depth. Epifauna consisting mostly of barnacles, sedentary polychaetes, sea urchins, and sea stars is abundant and species rich.",,
