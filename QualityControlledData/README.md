The source data from the ARMS-MBON project are harvested and placed here. These data are subjected to a basic quality control where necessary
  * Metadata are extracted [FromENA](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/FromENA) (Note: this folder is currently empty)
  * Metadata and data are downloaded from PlutoF to [FromPlutoF](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/FromPlutoF), this being the project data management platform used by ARMS-MBON
  * Metadata are extracted from the ARMS-MBON overview google sheet to [FromGS](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/FromGS)
  * The combined PlutoF and GS data are in [Combined](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/Combined): this includes the observatory, event, sample, omics, and image data
  
Data downloaded from PlutoF and the google sheet are subjected to a QC process, which involves downloading-checking-correcting-downloading again.
