QC steps done on the Plutof download

First steps - done just once in the beginning
1) An intial download of PlutoF created a seed spreadsheet called PlutoF_QC_StationsARMSnames.csv, containing 
   "Station", "Country", "ARMS unit" names as obtained from the entries in PlutoF (the Sampling areas, subSampling 
   Areas, and the "country" metadatum)
2) The columns "Station corrected", "Country corrected", "ARMS unit corrected" were added
3) Corrected values for those 3 parameters were added to the "corrected" columns; a blank entry means no correction necessary
   These corrections were chosen by the ARMS data manager (Katrina Exter at present) following suggestions made 
   to the ARMS partners (but not always followed)
4) To the PlutoF download script a routine was added to make these corrections to these stations, country, and arms units
   in the CSV files that hold all the PlutoF metadata. NOT corrected are the names of the Station folders, which use the 
   Station names as gotten from PlutoF 

Steps done before each subsequent PluotF download
1) Ideally, the data manager checks the file PlutoF_QC_StationsARMSnames.csv and updates (manually) by checking against 
   PlutoF
2) Upon a download of PlutoF, the corrections are made following the same procedure described above
3) A QC report is produced, this being a spreadsheet listing those stations and ARMS units as downloaded from PlutoF which was not in the file PlutoF_QC_StationsARMSnames.csv, or where something was in the file but not in PlutoF. An email is also sent with a reduced version of that spreadsheet.
