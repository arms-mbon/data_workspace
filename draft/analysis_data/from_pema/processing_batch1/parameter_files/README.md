These are the PEMA parameter files for this first processing batch that was run on the ARMS-MBON sequences. In these parameter files are all the parameters that were set in PEMA. Note that 
* we have the three gene types 18S, COI, and ITS
* the date the run was executed is part of the filename
* for ITS we used the UNITE reference database, for COI the Midori v2, and for 18S the pr2
To learn more about all other parameters that were set, read the respective parameter files. Note that the ENA run accession numbers of the sequences that were processed are not included in these parameter files: that information is contained in the [PEMA batch 1 overview](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/AnalysisData/FromPEMA/processing_batch1/pema_overview_batch1.xlsx), together with other relevant metadata. For more information on PEMA and its parameters, see [the PEMA GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema)
