These are the PEMA parameter files. Filenames include the following information:
* gene type (18S, COI, ITS)
* date the run was executed
* *WHAT* (e.g. v87, d10)
* reference database used (pr2, midori2, unite)

  The ENA run accession numbers of the sequences actually processed are not included in these parameter files: that information is contained in the [PEMA batch 1 overview](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/AnalysisData/FromPEMA/processing_batch1/pema_overview_batch1.xlsx), together with other relevant metadata.
