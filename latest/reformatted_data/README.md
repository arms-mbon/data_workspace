In here are data formatted for particular endpoints: 
* [IMIS](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/reformatted_data/imis): the datasets provided for the Integrated Marine Information System (VLIZ's datasets catalogue). FYI: for all ARMS data records in IMIS, type the following into your address bar: https://vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&show=search&Field=ARMS-MBON
* [LifeWatch](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/reformatted_data/lifewatch): for use in the ARMS workflow in the Tesseract

Note that these sources may not contain the entirety of the ARMS-MBON dataset (as this will depend on the needs of the respective endpoints), and these data are therefore not so useful to the general users: see instead [the combined data]([https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/qualitycontrolled_data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined) or data associated with publication releases such as [data release 1](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_release_001/tree/main).
