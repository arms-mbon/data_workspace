The CSV file [ARMS_Events_OmicsData](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/reformatted_data/imis/ARMS_Events_OmicsData.csv) contains metadata on the sampling events and the ENA accession numbers, for all ARMS-MBON sampling events to date (Sept 2023) which have any sequences archived in ENA. This file is created from the quality controlled input files: [sampling event combined data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_SamplingEventData.csv), and the [omics combined data](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_OmicsData.csv) 

The CSV file [ARMS_ImageData](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/reformatted_data/imis/ARMS_ImageData.csv) contains the metadata for the sampling events for which we have images or spreadsheets of manual observations. The download links to these data are contained in this spreadsheet, as the images themselves are too large to store here in GitHub. This file is a copy of the [same file](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined/combined_ImageData.csv)  in the combined folder and was also quality controlled. 

These CSVs are copied to the Marine Data Archive to be accessed via the 
IMIS metadata record: https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=8135.
