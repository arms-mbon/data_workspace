In here are the input and output files from the first batch of PEMA runs on the ARMS-MBON sequences, that were executed for ARMS-MBON samples that were collected from 2018 to 2020 and processed in April 2022. 

The following folders are included here:
* [ParameterFiles](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/analysis_data/from_pema/processing_batch1/parameter_files): the parameter files for the PEMA runs 
* [The taxonomic assignments](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/analysis_data/from_pema/processing_batch1/taxonomic_assignments): as output by PEMA
* [The fasta files](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/analysis_data/from_pema/processing_batch1/fasta): as output by PEMA

PEMA was run on sequences grouped by gene and by MiSeq sequencing run, and each group has its own parameter files, taxonomic assignment files, and fasta files. An overview of the processing -- including the material sample IDs, ENA accession numbers, dates and observatories etc -- from which one can identify which samples were processed in which group, is provided as [pema_overview_batch1.xlsx](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/analysis_data/from_pema/processing_batch1/pema_overview_batch1.xlsx).
