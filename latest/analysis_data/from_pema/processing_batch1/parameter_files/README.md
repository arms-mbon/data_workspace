These are the PEMA parameter files for this first processing batch that was run on the ARMS-MBON sequences. In these parameter files are all the parameters that were set in PEMA. Note that 
* We have the three gene types: 18S, COI, and ITS
* The date in the filenames refers to the date of the sequencing, rather than the date the material was collected
* for ITS we used the UNITE reference database, for COI Midori v2, and for 18S pr2

To learn more about all other parameters that were set, read the respective parameter files. Note that the ENA run accession numbers of the sequences that were processed are not included in these parameter files: that information is contained in the [PEMA batch 1 overview](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/analysis_data/from_pema/processing_batch1/pema_overview_batch1.xlsx), together with other relevant metadata. To know which of the parameter files listed here were used for any particular material sample / ENA sequence, you should also look at this overview file. For more information on PEMA and its parameters, see [the PEMA GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema).
