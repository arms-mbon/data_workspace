The taxonomic assignments from PEMA for COI and 18S from the batch 1 processing of the ARMS-MBON data have been curated by us to accommodate some issues
*  Due to a bug in V2.1.4 of PEMA (subsequently fixed), the assigments in the **Extended_final_tables for COI** only go to the genus level. The species-level assignments can be found in the tax_assignment files that accompany the final tables. We have extracted those species-level assignments and inserted those, together with their NBCI IDs, into new Extended_final_tables which we provide here. The format of the files is exactly the same. The code to do this and the outputs can be found here.
*  For 18S, the PR2 taxonomy is not so easy to compare to other taxonomies due to its unique organisation of taxon nodes used. In order to make more sensible use of these taxonomy results for our subsequent need to match the taxonomic assigments to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species), we have undertaken a curation of the taxonomic classification. The code for doing this curation and the outputs from the curation can be found here. It is up to the user of these data to decide whether they wish to adopt these for their own work, or not.
