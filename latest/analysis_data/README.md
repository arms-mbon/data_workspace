[PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema) is the metabarcoding analysis pipeline we use to process amplicon sequencing data from ARMS-MBON project events. Data resulting from the bioinformatics processing are stored here.
* [from_pema](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/analysis_data/from_pema) contains the inputs and outputs for all PEMA runs executed on ARMS-MBON data. Each processing batch has its own folder therein.
