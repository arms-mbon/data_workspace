The project was entitled BlueReef. The purpose of the BlueReef project was to restore and stabilise the structure and function of cavernous boulder reefs within an area of approx. 5ha, as well as to boost awareness among managers, planners and the general public about marine nature restoration, protection and management. Approximately 100.000 tons of rock was added to an existing old reef in 2007. Since then the reef has been monitored annually for both benthic and pelagic (fish and sea mamals) species.

Both locations are distant from Longyearbyen harbour and located just beneath large bird cliffs. Characterized by steep slope of rocks and boulders overlying mud. Lager boulders occur at S1 while at S2 there are rocky shelves withs smaller rocks coming down steeply down to e.g. 15 m depth. Kelp forest are present up to 10 m depth. ARMS were located on 14 m depth. Epifauna consisting mostly of barnacles, sedentary polychaetes, sea urchins, and sea stars is abundant and species rich.,,marine benthic biome [ENVO_01000024],,,,,
