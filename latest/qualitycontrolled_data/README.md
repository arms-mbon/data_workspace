The source data from the ARMS-MBON project are harvested and placed here. These data are subjected to a basic quality control where necessary
  * Metadata and data are downloaded from PlutoF to [from_plutof](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/qualitycontrolled_data/from_plutof), this being the project data management platform used by ARMS-MBON
  * Metadata are extracted from the ARMS-MBON overview google sheet to [from_gs](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/qualitycontrolled_data/from_gs)
  * The combined PlutoF and GS data are in [combined](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/qualitycontrolled_data/combined): this includes the observatory, event, sample, omics, and image data
  
Data downloaded from PlutoF and the google sheet are subjected to a QC process, which involves downloading-checking-correcting-downloading again. This happens every time a download is done. 

_**The status of the QC**_: main checks have been made, however with each harvest new checks are run and minor corrections made
