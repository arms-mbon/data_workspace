Plate labelling
The pictures of the plates were taken according to https://www.oceanarms.org/protocols/processing/plate-photos
However, we skipped step 5 as it was possible to assess general diversity from one picture.
Site 1 is AZFP IN 
Site 2 is AZFP OUT.
 
For example the label below come from site AZFP IN (Site 1 ARMS), it is the second plate in the sequence (Plate 2), and it is the bottom side (B)

Voucher Specimens (see attached xls file fro labelling information)
Images and xls sheet from Voucher specimens are under AZFP_Out_2018.
In the excel sheet you can find the Station name in column ?P?.
In time, we sent over five PCR-8-strips (one specimen in each well). This is an PCR-8-strips (because everybody gives it another name):
 
The five strips were labelled ?1?, ?2?, ?3?, ?4?, ?5?.
Within each strip there is an ?A? end and a ?H? end.
The first specimen in the first strip on the A-side is labelled: 1.1
The second specimen in the first strip on the A-side is labelled: 1.2
The first specimen in the second strip on the A-side is labelled: 2.1",9.5 - Subtidal Sandy-Mud,2,0,0,294,2019-11-11,2022-10-18
