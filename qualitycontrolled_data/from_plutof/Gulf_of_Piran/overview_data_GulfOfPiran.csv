This is a transient zone between infralittoral and circalittoral. Botoom is predominantly sandy mud, with coarse organic elements on the surface (sea shells). There are 4 cement tubes for excess meteor waters placed on the bottom and some patches of alochtonous pebbles that were brought there by meteor water and by during the construction works. On the coast there is a flysch cliff below which a 100m broad urbanised area (road, parking area, houses, water treatment plant) can be found. Coastline is represented by a wall of limestone rocks. Under this rocky wall there is a narrow rocky bottom with sandstones which changes to soft substrate along which artificial hard structures are set (4 meteor water pipelines).",9.5 - Subtidal Sandy-Mud,0,0,0,154,2019-11-11,2020-04-27
