Here you will find the combination of the quality-controlled (meta)data taken [from PlutoF](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/blob/main/QualityControlledData/FromPlutoF/) and from the [ARMS overview google sheet](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/tree/main/QualityControlledData/FromGS).

* [combined_ImageData.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/blob/main/QualityControlledData/Combined/combined_ImageData.csv): containing the image IDs, filenames and download URLs for each sampling event for each observatory. Where available, the ARMS plate number and face are also indicated (see the [ARMS Handbook](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Documentation/tree/main/Handbook) for more information). Only the sampling events with images are listed here.  
* [combined_ObservatoryData.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/blob/main/QualityControlledData/Combined/combined_ObservatoryData.csv): containing the observatory metadata.
* [combined_OmicsData.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/blob/main/QualityControlledData/Combined/combined_OmicsData.csv): containing the ENA accession numbers for all sequences that have been stored in ENA. Only sampling events with sequences are listed here. 
* [combined_SamplingEventData.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/Data/blob/main/QualityControlledData/Combined/combined_SamplingEventData.csv): containing a listing of all sampling events that have occurred to date. Included here are incomplete events, where ARMS units have only been emplaced and not yet retrieved. 

**Quality control**

The metadata here undergo a QC by comparing the PlutoF and google sheet entries as they are combined. Any corrections or additions that are found to be necessary in PlutoF or the google sheet are passed on to the ARMS partners, and once those corrections are made the process is repeated, until no more corrections are necessary.
