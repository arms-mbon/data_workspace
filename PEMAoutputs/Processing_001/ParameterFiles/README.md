Here are the input parameter files that were used to process the first batch of ARMS-MBON sequences with PEMA.

The filenames contain the following information:
* gene type (18S, COI, ITS)
* PEMA run date (e.g. April_2020)
* WHAT? (e.g. v97, d10)
* reference database used (pr2, midori2, unite)

The actual sequences that were processed are not included within these parameter files: that information is contained in the [PEMA batch1 overview file](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/blob/main/PEMAoutputs/Batch1/PEMAOverview_batch1.xlsx), together with other relevant metadata about this processing run.
