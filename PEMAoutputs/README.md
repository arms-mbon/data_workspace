[PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema) is a bioinformatics code we use to process the COI, 18S, and ITS data from ARMS-MBON. 

Runs of PEMA are performed on >=1 sequence (normally we run PEMA on dozens of raw sequences), for a single gene type at a time. For each batched run of PEMA that we are happy with (i.e. has been confirmed to produce generally good results), we create a separate folder here (numbered simply as ProcesingResults_###) containing the input and output files for that run.

Results from PEMA that are then published (as a data paper, a scientific paper, a GBif/EurOBIS record, etc) are taken from here and put in the repositories in this ARMS-MBON GitHub space called analysis_results_###
