[PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema) is a bioinformatics code we use to process the COI, 18S, and ITS data from ARMS-MBON. 

Runs of PEMA are performed on >=1 sequence, for a single gene type at a time. For each run of PEMA that we accept (i.e. has been confirmed to produce generally good results that we are happy to share), we create a separate folder here containing the input and output files for that run.

Results from PEMA that are then published (as a data paper, a scientific paper, a GBif/EurOBIS record, etc) are taken from here and put in the repositories called analysis_results_###
