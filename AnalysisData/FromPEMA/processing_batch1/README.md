In here are the input and output files from the first batch of runs on the ARMS-MBON sequences, that were executed in April 2022 for data largely from 2018 to 2020 

The following folders are included here:
* [ParameterFiles] (https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/AnalysisData/FromPEMA/processing_batch1/parameter_files): the parameter files for the PEMA runs 
* [So-called OTU tables](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/AnalysisData/FromPEMA/processing_batch1/taxonomic_assignments), aka the PEMA output files with the taxonomic assignments
